## MySQL Views Overview

The database contains several well-designed analytical views that can be leveraged for reporting:

### Cluster Performance Views

1. `dashboard_cluster_completeness_summary` - Shows reporting completeness by cluster
2. `dashboard_cluster_quarterly_rank` - Ranks clusters by quarterly performance
3. `vw_cluster_rank_annual` - Annual performance ranking of clusters
4. `vw_cluster_rank_by_quarter` - Quarterly performance ranking
5. `vw_cluster_rank_semiannual` - Semi-annual performance ranking
6. `vw_cluster_so_performance_summary` - Strategic objective performance by cluster


### Indicator Performance Views

1. `vw_annual_indicator_performance` - Annual performance of indicators
2. `vw_annual_performance_dashboard` - Dashboard view of annual performance
3. `vw_cluster_vs_target_achievements` - Compares actual vs target values
4. `vw_performance_over_time_by_quarter` - Quarterly performance trends
5. `vw_threshold_alerts_and_flags` - Highlights indicators needing attention


### Other Analytical Views

1. `vw_semi_annual_cluster_summary` - Semi-annual cluster performance summary
2. `vw_semi_annual_performance` - Semi-annual indicator performance
3. `vw_semi_annual_trend_analysis` - Trend analysis between first and second half of year
4. `vw_so_indicators_report` - Strategic objective indicator reporting
