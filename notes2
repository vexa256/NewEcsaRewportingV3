### Performance Monitoring System Reports Prioritization

Based on your database schema and menu structure, I'll recommend which reports to prioritize and the logic needed to ensure data accuracy. Let's focus on the most valuable reports first, with considerations for data cleaning and validation.

## Priority Reports to Implement First

### 1. Cluster Completeness Report

This should be your first priority as it shows which clusters have completed their reporting requirements.

**Logic for accuracy:**

-   Use the `vw_cluster_completeness_summary` view which already calculates completeness percentages
-   Implement validation to ensure all required indicators have responses
-   Add filters for timeline periods (year/quarter)
-   Include data quality checks to flag missing or inconsistent data

### 2. Quarterly Performance Dashboard

This provides a snapshot of performance by quarter, essential for regular monitoring.

**Logic for accuracy:**

-   Leverage `dashboard_cluster_quarterly_rank` view for ranking clusters
-   Implement proper numeric validation for all performance metrics
-   Ensure consistent calculation of achievement percentages
-   Add trend indicators to show improvement/decline from previous quarters

### 3. Performance Alerts Report

This helps identify areas needing immediate attention.

**Logic for accuracy:**

-   Use `vw_threshold_alerts_and_flags` view to identify underperforming indicators
-   Implement threshold validation to ensure alerts are triggered appropriately
-   Add severity levels based on percentage below target
-   Include contextual information about the indicator and its target

### 4. Strategic Objectives Performance Report

This connects operational metrics to strategic goals.

**Logic for accuracy:**

-   Use `vw_cluster_so_performance_summary` to aggregate indicator data by strategic objective
-   Implement weighted calculations if some indicators are more important than others
-   Ensure proper handling of different response types (Number, Boolean, Yes/No)
-   Add validation for target values to prevent division by zero errors

### 5. Annual Performance Summary

This provides a comprehensive view of yearly performance.

**Logic for accuracy:**

-   Use `vw_annual_indicator_performance` and `vw_annual_performance_dashboard` views
-   Implement year-over-year comparison logic
-   Ensure proper aggregation of quarterly data
-   Add validation for data completeness across all reporting periods

## Data Cleaning and Accuracy Logic

### 1. Response Type Validation

```plaintext
- For Number responses: Validate that values are numeric and within expected ranges
- For Yes/No responses: Standardize variations (Yes/True, No/False)
- For Text responses: Implement sanitization to prevent SQL injection
```

### 2. Target Value Validation

```plaintext
- Ensure target values are appropriate for their response types
- Prevent division by zero in percentage calculations
- Validate that target years match reporting periods
- Flag inconsistent or missing targets
```

### 3. Temporal Data Consistency

```plaintext
- Ensure data is properly aggregated across time periods
- Validate that quarterly data sums correctly to annual totals
- Check for missing reporting periods
- Implement proper handling of partial year data
```

### 4. Cross-Validation Between Views

```plaintext
- Compare results between related views to ensure consistency
- Implement reconciliation processes for discrepancies
- Use database transactions for data integrity
- Log validation errors for review
```

### 5. User Input Validation

```plaintext
- Implement front-end validation for all data entry forms
- Add server-side validation as a second layer of protection
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Implement data type conversion where appropriate
```

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with the core reports that provide the foundation for others
2. Implement data validation logic before building the UI components
3. Create reusable components for common report elements (filters, charts, tables)
4. Add export functionality after the reports are working correctly
5. Implement user permissions to control access to sensitive data

This approach will ensure you build a reliable reporting system with accurate data that stakeholders can trust for decision-making.
